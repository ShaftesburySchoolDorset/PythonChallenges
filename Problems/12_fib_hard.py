# Introduction

"""
According to wikipedia; in mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in
the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized
by the fact that every number in it is the sum of the two preceding ones:

1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

A number in a sequence (Fn), can be worked out wiht F(n-1) + F(n-2), where
F0 = 1, and F1 = 1. Therefore, F2 = 2
